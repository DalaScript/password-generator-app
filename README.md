## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- bem - [Block Element Modifier](https://getbem.com/introduction/)
- scss - [Sassy Cascading Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/for/)

### What I learned

It was a very interesting project and gave me great experience.

In this project, I worked extensively with range and checkbox input types, customizing their styles to look different from the default inputs.

I also wrote the logic for the slider input, which I did for the first time, and it was a very interesting experience.

I also learned how to copy text with a click of a button.

CSS pseudo-elements that I used for the first time.
```scss
/* Thumb: for Chrome, Safari, Edge */
&::-webkit-slider-thumb {}

/* Thumb: for Firefox */
&::-moz-range-thumb {}
```

### Continued development

I have already completed two JavaScript courses on freeCodeCamp, and I am currently taking the Front End Development Libraries course, where I’ve finished Bootstrap, jQuery, and Sass, and I’m now working through React.

Alongside this, I am working on projects and following a learning path on Frontendmentor.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is my favorite documentation platform I've been using since I started programming, it's the best explained resource.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I'm always looking for news and listening to other developers, sharing their experiences so that I can see many different solutions to a problem.
